Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a question from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and assured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work '),\n",

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth '),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

I have experienced many s uch acts of \\ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \\n \\nCourage in combating calamities \\nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha village \\nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot project on tele-education and \\ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned. Indira Gandh i National Open \\nUniversity has taken up the MBA Course for 34 Ethiopian students of Addis  Ababa and \\nHarmaya Universities.

I am extremely happy that Indian experience  in bringing the \\nbenefits of technology to the people has enabled us to work with Afric a to bring societal \\ntransformation in the African continent. \\n \\nDefending the nation: Our pride \\nI visited KUMAR in Siachen Glacier located at 17,000 feet altitude held by the Indian \\nArmy, had a memorable underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak and flew  in a Sukhoi-\\n30 fighter experiencing 2.5 g. In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the 540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

He expresses gratitude to everyone who has supported him during his tenure. He shares 10 important messages that he has learned during his interactions with people from various walks of life, including the youth, villages, rural areas, agriculture, and the nation as a whole. The messages emphasize the need to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerate development and fulfill the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empower villages and rural areas for competitiveness.\n",
      "3. Mobilize rural core competence for national growth.\n",
      "4. Focus on agriculture and food production.\n",
      "5. Overcome problems and succeed through determination.\n",
      "6. Partner with others to overcome challenges.\n",
      "7. Show courage in the face of calamities.\n",
      "8. Leverage connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "9. Defend the nation and its pride.\n",
      "10. Launch a youth movement to achieve Developed India 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020, and he assured her that it was indeed a thoughtful question and that he would work towards making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker was asked by Anukriti \"why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020\". The speaker appreciated the question, considered it thoughtful, and assured Anukriti that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and youth in India to achieve its development goals. The speaker, likely the President of India, shares their experience visiting a village in Nagaland where they saw an empowered village council functioning effectively and taking decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the potential for transformation in India's 600,000 villages if they are connected to each other and to urban societies through quality roads and other infrastructure. It also mentions the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has established a \"PURA\" complex in 65 villages, providing urban amenities such as healthcare centers, education, and vocational training.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness and generating employment opportunities, which would help to achieve India's development goals by 2020. Overall, the speech emphasizes the need to empower villages and youth to achieve a prosperous, safe, and proud India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban-Rural Action) project in Thanjavur district. The project has created a sustainable economic development model, generating employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for villagers. Specifically, the project has:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Developed 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land\n",
      "* Enabled villagers to cultivate Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, as well as generate power using biomass\n",
      "* Established food processing and marketing centers\n",
      "* Empowered 1000 self-help groups\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has also collaborated with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative abilities of the villagers. The speaker believes that similar PURA projects are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with a goal of establishing 7000 such projects nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. The first is a visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they met over 6,000 farmers from various states and union territories. The farmers showed interest in the various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced land, water, and manpower, and improving the nation's economic condition through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is a meeting with a person named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands or legs. Despite his physical limitations, he had a radiant smile and a positive attitude. When asked what the speaker could do for him, he replied that he didn't need anything and instead wanted to sing in front of them. The speaker was inspired by Vidwan's confidence and positivity, and the experience taught them to focus on the problems and succeed despite them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two inspiring stories. The first story is about a physically challenged individual who, with the support of his parents, teachers, and others, discovers his talent for music and decides to share it with others. Despite his physical limitations, he is able to sing beautifully and even performs in a prestigious theater.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the resilience of the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited the village and was impressed by the villagers' courage and determination to overcome their losses and rebuild their lives. Despite the severe damage to their school building and other challenges, the villagers were able to come together and overcome their problems, rather than allowing them to control their lives. The speaker highlights the importance of partnership and cooperation in overcoming the impact of disasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a reflection on the author's experiences with courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The author shares two specific incidents:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In a village affected by an earthquake, they saw children and villagers bravely participating in relief efforts alongside the armed forces. The author also witnessed the on-spot settlement of relief grants by authorities, which was a heartening sight.\n",
      "2. During a visit to Car Nicobar Islands in 2005, the author met Tribal Council Leaders and students who had been affected by the 2004 Tsunami. Despite the severe losses, the islanders had taken in the affected victims as their own, showing remarkable courage and resilience. The author was moved by their story and composed a poem, \"Sea Waves\", which the islanders sang with enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author also mentions a speech they gave at the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2004, where they addressed 53 member countries of the African Union. However, the summary provided does not include the details of that speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network at the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa on September 16, 2004. The network would connect 53 African countries at a cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, and 53 telemedicine and education centers in Africa. A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, where students from two universities are taking an MBA course online, and a telemedicine project has been commissioned, allowing specialists from India to remotely consult with patients in Ethiopia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a address by a high-ranking official or leader, possibly the Prime Minister of India, to a gathering of people. The speaker is highlighting several achievements and initiatives of India, particularly in the fields of technology and defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker mentions that India has been providing tele-consultation services to doctors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, using the Pan African network, and is proud to have worked with the African continent to bring about societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also expresses pride in the bravery and dedication of India's defense forces, highlighting their efforts to defend the nation and protect its citizens. The speaker mentions specific experiences, including visits to military bases, parades, and interactions with troops, and praises the valour, commitment, and devotion to duty of the defense forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions a youth movement called Lead India 2020, which aims to transform young citizens into enlightened individuals. The speaker met with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are actively working towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is highlighting the positive impact of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, on the youth of Andhra Pradesh, particularly in Medak district. The foundation is training thousands of students in partnership with the district administration, and the results are impressive, with students showing increased self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a sense of responsibility towards the nation. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student who was able to influence her father to quit smoking after attending the Lead India Training Camp. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of empowering the youth through value-based education and leadership, noting that the 540 million young people under the age of 25 in India are a powerful resource that needs to be harnessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization, while also highlighting the country's progress and potential for future growth. The speaker notes that India has made significant strides in the last 60 years, particularly with its youth population, and expresses confidence that the country can become a developed nation by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also emphasizes the need for collective effort and participation from multiple institutions to achieve this goal. They highlight the importance of empowering individuals who are willing to contribute to the nation's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes by outlining a distinctive profile for a developed India by 2020, which includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "* Equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "* Synergy between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "* Education with a value system, free from societal or economic discrimination\n",
      "* Attracting the best scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker ends the speech by referencing a famous poem, \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" which emphasizes the importance of aiming high and believing that one's goals can be achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines the ideal goals for a nation, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ensuring equal opportunities for all citizens, regardless of societal or economic discrimination.\n",
      "2. Attracting the best scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "3. Providing access to high-quality healthcare for all.\n",
      "4. Establishing a responsive, transparent, and corruption-free government.\n",
      "5. Eradicating poverty and illiteracy, and eliminating crimes against women and children.\n",
      "6. Creating a society where everyone feels included and valued, with no sense of alienation.\n",
      "7. Achieving long-term prosperity, health, security, peace, and happiness, with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
